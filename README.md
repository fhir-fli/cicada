## 100% Credit goes to the CDC and their [Clinical Decision Support for Immunization (CDSi)](https://www.cdc.gov/iis/cdsi/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/iis/cdsi.html)

All I've done is take all of their hard work, guidance and expertise and make it computable (well, perhaps it's already computable, I made a computer actually do it).

## [Implementation Guide](cicada_ig/output/index.html)

In an attempt to practice my FSH, I've created an IG based on CDSI.
